So, this is just supposed to be a blank page, with a lot of text. Literally. That's It. I don't even know how you got here. Did i do something wrong? I thought i deleted the <a href=> part for this page. Maybe i even did, but if i did, you would not be here. Maybe
you used the cosmic power of the universe to get here. I don't even know myself what that is. If you do, could you tell me? Maybe this is just my imagination. Maybe this is just your imagination. Could i be dreaming? Could you be dreaming? Do you have to go to
school tomorrow? If so, you are probably sleeping, imagining this page, reading this text that is not even supposed to be here. Do you like your birthday? If so, think about it. The cake, a party, playing with friends, you getting the things you have been wanting
for years on end. You have all those positive thoughts, while i am just a file named "yeti", that's not even supposed to exist, or be accessed. I just have numbers on the left, at the top i have "File", "Edit", "Selection", "View", "Go", "Run", "Terminal" and
"Help". What could this mean? Is death near? Is it...not? What is considered as near? Neighbors? Neighbor numbers? Those are technically infinite. One is the neighbor number of two. Three is a neighbor number of two too. Four is a neighbor number of three. Hey!
Maybe we can just count numbers together! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. You seem to be bored reading this... Maybe you need to read some more numbers. Elevel, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, 
twenty. Are you even still here? Wait, why are you still even here? You were supposed to go, don't you remember? I would never gaslight someone, so you really do.
